Competition is ongoing, with the below methods I have held a rank of [289/1396] among the top 21% on 1st Jan 2017 

The goal in this competition is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is. The data for this competition were taken from the MNIST dataset.

• Implemented different machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Method) to improve the accuracy of model.
• Final model submitted is an CNN which resulting in 97.67% training and 95.32% validation accuracy, the performance was boosted using Stochastic gradient descent optimizer and hyper tuning of parameter to 99.77% training and 99.59% validation accuracy. Model achieved 99.04 % accuracy on the test dataset surpassing the previous model with accuracy of 97.51%.
